      <h1>Carpentry Basics: Types of Wood Joints</h1>

      <p>
        Understanding the different types of wood joints is fundamental for any
        carpentry project. This guide covers some of the most common and useful
        joints.
      </p>

      <h2>Butt Joint</h2>
      <p>
        The simplest form of joint is the
        <span class="important">butt joint</span>, where the end of one piece of
        wood is butted against another and secured with glue, nails, or screws.
        Ideal for simple constructions, but not the strongest joint.
      </p>

      <h2>Dovetail Joint</h2>
      <p>
        Known for its resistance to being pulled apart (tensile strength), the
        <span class="important">dovetail joint</span> is commonly used in drawer
        construction. Its interlocking design makes it one of the strongest and
        most aesthetic wood joints.
      </p>

      <h2>Mortise and Tenon Joint</h2>
      <p>
        A staple in woodworking, the
        <span class="important">mortise and tenon joint</span> involves
        inserting the tenon (a square or rectangular post) into a mortise (a
        hole of the same shape). This joint is celebrated for its strength and
        versatility in various applications.
      </p>

      <h2>Lap Joint</h2>
      <p>
        In a <span class="important">lap joint</span>, two pieces of wood
        overlap each other. It's a stronger alternative to the butt joint and
        can be used in frame and box constructions. Depending on the project,
        different types of lap joints can be used, such as the half-lap or
        cross-lap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each type of joint has its specific uses and benefits. Choosing the
        right joint depends on the requirements of the carpentry project,
        including strength, aesthetics, and the type of wood being used.
